# pdf_to_img
Python script saving images in .pdf as .png files.



"Move the pdf file (or files) to the folder with the pdf_to_img.py file, run the commands in cmd (opened in .py file localization):
- pip install pymupdf (only if pymupdf is missing)
- python .\pdf_to_img.py

a new folder called 'images' will be created in the folder with the script, where you will find the images of the pdf file converted to png."
